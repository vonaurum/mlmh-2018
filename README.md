CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------------------------

4 page submissions due by May 8, 2018

Over the recent years, the decreasing cost of data acquisition and ready
availability of data sources such as Electronic Health records (EHR), claims,
administrative data and patient-generated health data (PGHD), as well as
unstructured data, have led to an increased focus on data-driven and ML methods
for medical and healthcare domain. From the systems biology point of view,
large multimodal data typically including omics, clinical measurements, and
imaging data are now readily available. Valuable information for obtaining
mechanistic insight into the disease is also currently available in
unstructured formats for example in the scientific literature. The storage,
integration, and analysis of these data present significant challenges for
translational medicine research and impact on the effective exploitation of the
data. Furthermore, intelligent analysis of observational data from EHR and PGHD
sources and integration of insights generated from the same to the system
biology sphere can greatly improving patient experience, outcome, and improving
the overall health of the population while reducing per capita cost of care.
However, the black-box nature, inherent in some of the best performing ML
methods, has widened the gap between how human and machines think and often
failed to provide explanations to make insights actionable. In the new era with
users of “right for explanation”, this is detrimental to the adoption in
practice. To drive the usage of such rich yet heterogeneous datasets into
actionable insights, we aim to bring together a wide array of stakeholders,
including practitioners, biomedical and data science specialists, and industry
solution subject matter experts. We will seek to start discussions in the area
of precision medicine as well as the importance of interpretability of ML
models towards the increased practical use of ML in medicine and healthcare.
